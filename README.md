## :information_source: About

Shiro 白 is a small monolithic x86 &amp; 64 Kernel which is able to process input and provide output accordingly.

The name "Shiro" itself is the Japanese word for "white" written in [Romaji](https://www.japanesepod101.com/japanese-romaji/). The symbol (白) is the japanese [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) for the word "white". 

I wanted to learn a bit about kernel development. And that's basically the whole purpose of this project/repository.

## :clipboard: Documentation

> **Note:** This is _not_ a documentation about the Kernel! This is more like a history of things I did to make everything work. It is basically an explanation of each step I made in the development (this is a good way for me to learn).

My main technologies I use for the development are: 

> - NASM for Bootloader stuff 
> - C for the Kernel itself 
> - Bash for build scripts
> - Qemu as my Type 2 Hypervisor / Emulator 
> - VSCode as my IDE 

- [1.](#doc-1) - **Boot Sector**: <br>
    The first step is to tell the bootloader that Shiro is an OS and that it's bootable. I did this by writing a small NASM code which compiles to a binary.
    - First we create an infinite loop
    - Then we fill the boot sector (512 bytes)
    - And finally end the binary with the 16-Bit magic number `0xAA55`

- [2.](#doc-2) - **Build script**: <br>
    Second step and we already have to write a build script. The boot sector code is written in NASM. So we need to compile a binary out of it first.
    - Create a directory to store our binaries
    - Compile binary with `$ nasm -f bin ./boot_sector.asm -o ./bin/boot_sector.bin`
    - Launch the Kernel with `$ qemu-system-x86_64 ./bin/boot_sector.bin`

- [3.](#doc-3) - **Enter TTY Mode in Boot Sector**: <br>
    We will enter TTY mode in the boot sector and output our Kernel name.

    - We use `0x0E` on `ah` to tell the video interrupt that we want to write the content of `al` (lower part of the `ax` register) in TTY mode.

- [4.](#doc-4) - **Splitting into functions**: <br>
    No we will try to split our boot sector into multiple functions. For instance we want to have a print function. Some notes:

    - The BIOS places the boot sector at `0x7C00`
    - So `[org 0x7c00]` tells the assembler that our offset is the bootsector code
    - `bx` is our base address for the strings
    - We basically iterate over our string and push each character into the `al` register IF it is not there already
    - We stop once the last character is null
    - We use `bx` as our index pointer (the string is like a char array and bx is our index)
    - `mov al, 0x0a` is a new-line character
    - `mov al, 0x0d` is a carriage return
    - in our bootloader_main.asm file we include subroutines below the hang because we need to make sure the parameters are ready
